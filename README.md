## How to Use This Repository

This repository is organized into multiple topic-based Markdown files.
Start with **basics.md**, then move into branching, merging, remotes, stash, etc.
Each file contains numbered commands, examples, and explanations.

## Motivation

I created this repository as a personal Git reference guide so I don’t
have to Google commands repeatedly. It helps beginners understand Git
clearly with simple explanations and examples.
