🚫 Git Ignore — Complete Guide
🔥 1. What is .gitignore?

.gitignore is a special file that tells Git which files or folders should not be tracked.

You use it to ignore:

- Temporary files
- Build/output folders
- Environment files with secrets
- OS-specific junk files
- Log files

Any file pattern added in .gitignore will be skipped by Git unless already tracked.
